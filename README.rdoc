== README

This is a todo-list sample app that combines Angular.js, Yeoman generator, 
and Rails.  

The app is based on several different tutorials, including: 
http://yeoman.io/codelab.html
https://shellycloud.com/blog/2013/10/how-to-integrate-angularjs-with-rails-4
http://asanderson.org/posts/2013/06/03/bootstrapping-angular-rails-part-1.html

Some notes: 

* cross-domain requests 
  CORS was needed to support cross-domain requests. It's possible to setup Angular
to proxy requests to your rails app instead, if you like. For more info on CORS 
setup see https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors  or look in application.rb. 

* angular modules
  Bower is used to install angular modules; this app adds to the basic 
  Yeoman-generated app the following modules: 
    * angular-route
    * angular-ui-sortable 
    * ng-resource (may not be needed)
    * angular-resource

  It is unclear to me whether ng-resource is absolutely needed, or if
  angular-resource is sufficient.

Getting started:
* checkout repo
* bundle install
cd angular
bower install
grunt test
grunt serve

angular app will be listening on localhost:9000 ; rails app on localhost:3000
